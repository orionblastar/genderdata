# genderdata
Facebook, NY State, Internet, and other sources scraped to make a list of genders, hope we have them all here

This is the first attempt at such a list, as I was the first one
to decide to make one after reading this https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14511562

Just make sure this list is not used to discriminate against people.
We don't want any problems from it.

I guess it is used for Census or Statistics reason?

We might add later ethnics, religion, and other data
and make it free for all to download and use in their programs
and databases.

This is the best serious attempt at gathering this information
and putting it all in one format. So this is history making right here.

Feel free to add or remove items from the list if you decide to fork it.
